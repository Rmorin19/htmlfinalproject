        Emissaries are a way for pirates to represent one of the five trading
        companys. Sailing as an emissary will provide your crew with many
        benefits like higher payouts and reputation gains and specific treasure
        items for the company that your crew is representing. The companys that
        you can represent are the
        <u>
          Gold Hoarders, Order of Souls, the Merchant Alliance, Reaper's Bones,
          and Athena's Fortune.
        </u>
        To represent a company one of your crew mates must buy the emissary flag
        of that company. Each flag cost 20000 gold. Emissaries have 5 grades
        that will give a higher bonus for each grade as well as a higher flag
        retrieval bonus. Each company will have a emissary quest that will be
        unlocked at grade V.

      <h2 style="margin-right: 500px; margin-left: 650px">Gold Hoarders</h2>
      <p class="center">
        The <b>Gold Hoarders</b> emissary flag can be bought from any gold
        hoarder at the outposts. The <b>Gold Hoarders</b> emissary quest can be
        bought from any gold hoarder once the crew has reached emissary grade 5.
        To get to higher grades you must bring treasure chests to the gold
        hoarders. Unfortuantly only one emissary quest may be bought per
        emissary flag. The <b>Gold Hoarders</b> quest gives the crew 4 treasure
        maps with 5 x's each. The chest's unearthed will always be Captain's
        chests.

      <h2 style="margin-right: 500px; margin-left: 650px">Order of Souls</h2>
      <p class="center">
        The <b>Order of Souls</b> emissary much like the
        <b>Gold Hoarders</b> emissary requires you to bring treasure to rank up
        but to them tresure is skeleton sculls. To get these sculls you must
        fight waves of skeletons in the strongholds. Another thing you can do is
        fight skeleton captains that can be found on many islands through out
        the ocean. The skeleton captains will drop sculls aswell. This emissary
        quest gives the crew bounty maps with skeleton captains that will each
        drop a scull.

      <h2 style="margin-right: 500px; margin-left: 650px">Merchant Alliance</h2>
      <p class="center">
        The <b>Merchant Alliance's</b> way of ranking up is for you to give them
        Crates, Animals, Gunpower Barrels or Mermaid Gems. You can find these
        things on most islands and you should not find much trouble getting
        them. This quest will have your crew recive to maps with 10 crates that
        must be delivered to other merchants in 30 in game days.

      <h2 style="margin-right: 500px; margin-left: 650px">Reper's Bones</h2>
      <p class="center">
        The <b>Repers Bones</b> emissary will grant you the ability to rank up after
        you returne with the emissary flags of others aswell as treasure. To get
        the flags you must sink there ships. The flag can only be bought at
        Reapers Hideout from the servant of the flame. Once you have reached
        grade V you will be able to see other ships on your map making it easier
        to find and sink other ships. Unfortuantly this emissary doesn't have a
        quest and the only place to give back the flags and treasure is Reapers
        Hideout it is a more difficult emissary.

        acknowledged as a pirate lord. You can get the flag at Athena's Hideout
        or from mysterious srangers in taverns. The quest wil give your crew a
        treasure map with 7 x's, a riddle map that finds a collectors chest and
        a bounty map with 4 skeleton captains to kill. Once those tasks have
        been completed you will recive a treasure map with 2 x's with one
        unearthing a chest of legends and the other a keg of ancient black
        powder.
